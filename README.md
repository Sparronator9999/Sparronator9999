### About me

- Currently studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at university.
- A computer/electronics enthusiast (i.e. I like to tinker with my computers, phones, etc.)
- Creator of [YAMDCC](https://github.com/Sparronator9999/YAMDCC), which I update when I'm not getting buried in uni work.
- Other projects I write in my spare time get uploaded to GitHub if I think they'll benefit someone (or occasionally if someone asks nicely).

### Programming languages
I can* write code in the following programming languages:

- **C# (.NET)**: My current main programming language, which all* of my main projects are written in.
  - I primarily use WinForms as the UI (for graphical applications), because I haven't had success with WPF in the past, and haven't tried any other UI toolkits.
- **Python**: I only learnt this for university so far.
- **Web (HTML/CSS/JS)**: I've written a few web pages before, mostly for school/university assignments.
- **Java**: See Python.
- **Pascal** for custom installer logic for [YAMDCC](https://github.com/Sparronator9999/YAMDCC).
- **VB.NET**: Basically C# with different syntax.
- **Batch (Windows CMD)**: I used to write .bat scripts a few years ago, mostly wrappers around commands (e.g. a `certutil` wrapper to encode/decode base64).
  - I haven't tried PowerShell (.ps1) before, and haven't done much in Bash (.sh) either.
- **C(++)** (kind of): The only public C++ code I've "written" (read: hacked together) is for [melonDS](https://github.com/melonDS-emu/melonDS), to reduce the high audio latency when playing e.g. rhythm games.
- ...and possibly more that I haven't listed here. And Markdown doesn't count.
