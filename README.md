### About me

- I'm currently studying for a Bachelor of Information Technology at university.
- I consider myself a computer/electronics enthusiast (i.e. I like to tinker with my computers, phones, etc.)
- I sometimes code in my spare time. If the resulting programs are good enough (and I think they'll benefit someone), I upload them here.
- Languages I can code in include C#, Python and web (HTML/CSS/JS).

### Programming languages
I can* write code in the following programming languages:

- **C# (.NET)**: My current main programming language.
  - I primarily use WinForms as the UI (for graphical applications), because I haven't had success with WPF in the past, and haven't tried any other UI toolkits.
- **Python**: My most recently learned programming language. Still getting used to the syntax :p
  - I haven't written any graphical applications in Python yet.
- **Web (HTML/CSS/JS)**: I've written a few web pages before, mostly for school/university assignments.
- **VB.NET**: Basically C# with different syntax.
- **Batch (Windows CMD)**: I used to write .bat scripts a few years ago, mostly wrappers around commands (e.g. a `certutil` wrapper to encode/decode base64).
  - I haven't tried PowerShell (.ps1) before, and haven't done much in Bash (.sh) either.
- ...and possibly more that I haven't listed here. And Markdown doesn't count.
